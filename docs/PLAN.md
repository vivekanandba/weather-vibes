## 1. Project Overview

### 1.1 Vision Statement
Weather Vibes is an intuitive, theme-based weather discovery engine that closes the gap between what people want to do and when and where is the best time to do it. Instead of asking users to interpret complex weather charts, we ask them about their desired "vibe" and translate that into actionable recommendations using NASA's climate data.

### 1.2 Core Features
- **Feature 1:** "Where" - The Vibe Hotspot Finder
- **Feature 2:** "When" - The Vibe Calendar
- **Feature 3:** Specialized Aura Advisors (Advanced)

### 1.3 Technical Stack
- **Frontend:** Next.js, React, Chakra UI, Zustand, Mapbox GL JS
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI
- **Data:** NASA POWER API, GeoTIFF files, AWS S3
- **Geospatial:** rasterio, geopandas

### 1.4 Target Audience
- Travel enthusiasts and bloggers
- Event organizers
- Hobbyists (astronomy, photography, outdoor activities)
- Farmers and agricultural professionals
- Wellness-focused individuals

## 7. Risk Management

### 7.1 Identified Risks

| Risk | Impact | Probability | Mitigation Strategy | Owner |
|------|--------|-------------|---------------------|-------|
| NASA API rate limiting | High | Medium | Implement caching, batch requests | Kiran |
| Large GeoTIFF file sizes | Medium | High | Optimize file format, use compression | Kiran |
| Mapbox quota exceeded | Medium | Low | Monitor usage, implement fallback | Bhawesh |
| API performance issues | High | Medium | Implement caching, optimize queries | Vivek |
| Data processing time | Medium | High | Start early, use parallel processing | Kiran |
| Browser compatibility | Low | Medium | Test early, use polyfills | Bhawesh |
| Deployment issues | Medium | Low | Test deployment early | All |
| Team member unavailability | High | Low | Cross-training, documentation | All |

### 7.2 Contingency Plans

#### If Data Processing Takes Too Long:
- Reduce geographical coverage (focus on India)
- Limit historical data range (3 years instead of 10)
- Start with 3 vibes instead of 5+

#### If API Performance Is Poor:
- Implement aggressive caching (Redis)
- Precompute common queries
- Use CDN for static data

#### If Frontend Development Falls Behind:
- Simplify UI design
- Use pre-built Chakra UI components
- Focus on core functionality first
